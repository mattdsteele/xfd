## How long would it take your organization to deploy a change that involves just one single line of code? 

## Do you do this on a repeatable, reliable basis?

# Writing your own Actions
--

* Code in TypeScript (or JS)
--

* `@actions/core`, `@actions/github`, `@actions/io`
--

* Starter Template: [typescript-action](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action)

---

```ts
import { context } from '@actions/github';
```

--

```js
{
  action: "opened",
  issue: {
    assignee: null,
    assignees: [],
    author_association: "OWNER",
    body: "Some info in the comment here.\r\n\r\n# Lol",
    comments_url: "https://api.github.com/repos/mattdsteele/salty-issue-detector/issues/2/comments",

# Pro Tips

* TypeScript Actions need transpiled and their `node_modules` checked in
* [zeit/ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) is a good option
* Issues using an Action? [Fork it!](https://github.com/gimenete/github-jest-snapshots/pull/1)
* Integration testing `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
* Local runners if you hate the ‚òÅ

---
# GitHub Actions

* GA November 13
* Free for public repos
* Free tier (2,000 mins/mo) for private repos

---
exclude: true

* https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-a-javascript-action
* https://github.com/zeit/ncc Need to package dependencies up
* Example context https://github.com/mattdsteele/salty-issue-detector/commit/bd8f07adc18a8da8290324e53570d260a40eec5e/checks?check_suite_id=285155748#step:3:5
* Greet first issuer https://github.com/JJ/issue-greeting-action/blob/master/src/main.ts
* Labs is good way to learn the process


## Issues

* Local testers (not working yet) https://github.com/nektos/act https://github.com/phishy/wflow

* Generally available November 13

* Think of it like IFTTT for anything on GH
* You build it, runs on GitHub

Why better than others?

* Forkable https://github.com/gimenete/github-jest-snapshots/pull/1
